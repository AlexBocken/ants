# ants
A reimplementation of Schweitzer et al. 1996 as well as additional improvemnts for the Course Agent Based Modelling for Social Systems FS2023 ETH ZÃ¼rich


For the course [Agent Based Modelling for Social Systems FS2023](https://www.vorlesungen.ethz.ch/Vorlesungsverzeichnis/lerneinheit.view?lerneinheitId=167292&semkez=2023S&ansicht=LEHRVERANSTALTUNGEN&lang=de) we were tasked to implement a model of our own (in groups).
For this, we decided to implement an enhanced version of [Active random walkers simulate trunk trail formation by ants (Schweitzer et al. 1996)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030326479601670X?casa_token=fv82ToWDN3cAAAAA:wB5hHIlxnYBBvyuHb98YUFpXqWqGt50xDRnmAZ_UaMS5khR9IiH8K6m1b5gdqkAe1ACXx_lEy2U) using Python and Mesa.


For now, wanted features can be found in our [shortlist](shortlist.md).
For everything else start at [main py](main.py)
